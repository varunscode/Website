            <h2>1.1	Describing the purpose of IT in modern business  </h2>

            IT is increasingly becoming the driving force for business around the world. Traditionally IT has been used within businesses for storing their customer and sales data but has evolved to solve a plethora of business needs. Nowadays IT is used for advanced analytics to identify trends that can be used to make informative decision for the business. With the implementation of machine learning and AI businesses are becoming more and more automated which reduces the need for human input.
            Nowadays entire businesses can be run from the comfort of your own home.

            <h2>1.2	Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?  </h2>

            For digital projects logical thinking is one of the most important skills to have as this helps guide you through problems in an effective manner. Visual Studio is a great app for digital projects as it is simple to use and can work with multiple coding languages including Python and HTML.
            To complete digital projects successfully collaborative and communicative skills are also essential due to the benefits that team working can bring. 
            To facilitate working on digital projects using the right tools are essential. Trello is an excellent project management tool that helps manage tasks for a project, it uses the Kanban methodology to organise these tasks which can also be assigned to different team members. 
            Another great tool is draw.io which is a web-based app that is used for building flowcharts, this tool is especially useful for designing code as the logic can be visualised and makes writing up the code even easier.

            <h2> 1.3	Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.  </h2>

            Trello is a great web application for organising projects as it visualises the tasks that need to be done, are being worked on at the moment or are complete.  I am going to plan my website by first drawing the basic layout of my main page and where the links to the other pages will be along with the main bodies of text. This will allow me to have a clear picture of what it should look like and what needs to be done for the website to come together. 
            I will break each task down into small manageable tasks and list them on Trello updating them as I go along.

            <h2>1.4	Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?  </h2>

            Insufficient planning can cause a lot of digital projects to fail. Planning allows you to predict some of the issues that you may face as you execute the project and plan provisions accordingly. 
            The reliability of your technology is also a large contributing factor to the success of digital projects.
            If your computer is to crash so will your progress on the project so to minimise this risk its essential to save work frequently and even upload it online so that a backup is available in case something goes wrong.

            <h2>1.5	Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?  </h2>
            
            The IT systems and software would depend on the project itself, for example a backend development project could all be executed on a code editor like Visual Studio Code. It should be noted that Visual Studio Code can also deal with some frontend development languages like HTML so I will also be using it for the web development project.

            <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control   </h2>
            
            Visual studio code was a great code editor to write my code on, it was easy to use and had a lot of functionality. The best feature I found was the predictive text which made writing code much more efficient.
            Trello was a great software for project management, it allowed for efficient team working as members could take on extra tasks if they had free time rather than wait to be assigned something. 
            Version control is a way to keep track of changes you make within your code just in case something goes wrong, this makes it easy to revert back to an older working version of your code. This can often leave you with hundreds of files but using git can make this much smoother and easier to implement while GitHub makes the older versions of code available online making it easy to access anywhere in the world [1]

            <h2>1.7	Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?  </h2>
            
            GDPR stands for general data protection regulation and is a legislation that changes the way personal data is processed. When users input data into digital projects this data would be liable to GDPR and must be dealt with and kept safe according to the guidelines.  </div>

            <h2>1.1 	Describing the content and layout for each page  </h2>

            My website will be a personal portfolio for my work like an online CV. The home page will be an overview of me and my achievements and will link to other pages which will go into depth about other accomplishments and projects. Each page will have a different background image and vary with its layout to provide variety.

            <h2>1.5	Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites  </h2>
            For something to qualify for copyright it must be original and created by its author. If you recreate this content without permission from its owner, you are considered to be breaching this copyright data.

            <h2> 1.6	Describing access issues that need taking into account – describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.  </h2>

            Disabilities in this scenario refers to people with limited visual, sensory, physical or cognitive function which affects their access to the web [3]. 
            There are different methods websites can use to help people with disabilities use their sites.
